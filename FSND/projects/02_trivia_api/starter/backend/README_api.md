### Frontend

Implemented with React. Install dependencies and develop locally with npm as follows.

```

### Database Setup

PostgreSQL + psql

With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:

```bash
psql trivia < trivia.psql
```

### Backend

Python 3.7 + Flask + SQLAlchemy

API endpoints are implemented with Flask and data are stored in a PostgreSQL instance.

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies in `/backend` folder:

cd backend
virtualenv --no-site-packages env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the server, execute:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
